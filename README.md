# tucana-iso
An ISO generator for Tucana that works off mercury.  Basically just does an install and mounts an overlayfs tmpfs write layer on boot.  ISOLinnu for Legacy bios support Standalone grub efi.img generator for EFI systems.  Remarkably simple and incredibly fast boot times and speed.
Don't use this for non-Tucana-based systems.  Most of this stuff is custom compiled or custom generated/hand-picked for an LFS-based system.

If you do want to use this for an LFS/ Tucana system however, go straight ahead if you have any problems file an issue.
